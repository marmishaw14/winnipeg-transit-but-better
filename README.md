# Winnipeg Transit Bus Arrival Display and Analytics Platform 🚍

## Project Background
### I'm building this software because quite frankly, Winnipeg Transit is unreliable and sucks. I'm building this to get a better idea of when to leave my house when wanting to catch the bus aside from the ETA from the Transit app (which isn't always accurate)

## Project Objective
### This project is being built to display bus arrival time for a user's given stop. It makes use of real-time data, as well as historical on-time performance data to provide better insights into when a bus at a given stop will be arriving. The goal is to give transit riders a better idea of if they should arrive at their stop significantly earlier than suggested on the app, as well as insights into which stops (or areas) of stops have poor arrival times. Transit pass-up data is also utilized to notify the user whether the time they leave their stop has significant pass-up incidents or not.
